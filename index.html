        <pre>           <i>That’s 795 million people on the planet who suffer from chronic hunger, according to
            the United Nations World Food Program The U.N. forecasts that an additional 2
            billion people will be lacking food by 2050. In addition, 1 in 3 people suffer from
            some form of malnutrition, which means they lack sufficient vitamins and minerals
            in their diet, which can lead to health issues such as stunted growth in children. Most
            of the world’s hungry people live in developing countries, with Asia as the continent
            with the most hungry people — about 526 million — according to U.N. data. Each
             year, poor nutrition kills 3.1 million children under the age of 5</i></pre>

     <pre><i>           Sometimes the food is simply lost or wasted. According to the global humanitarian
           aid agency Mercy Corps, factors responsible for food loss include inefficient farming
           techniques, lack of storage for crops after they have been harvested, and poor
           management and market connections.
           Food loss and waste amounts to about $680 billion in industrialized countries
          and $310 billion in developing countries, according to the U.N. Every year, consumers in
          wealthy nations waste almost as much food (222 million tons) as the entire net food 
          production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tons), the agency reported. And food 
          wasted in Europe could feed 200 million people.

           <pre><i>         Since the 1960s, global agricultural production has outpaced
         population growth. Yet the Malthusian theory continues to focus
         on the risk of population increases outstripping the Earth’s
         carrying capacity, even though global population is peaking.

         Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen’s study of the Great Bengal Famine
         of 1943 challenged Malthus by demonstrating that millions died
         of hunger because they didn’t have the money to buy food, not
         due to food shortages.</i></pre>
